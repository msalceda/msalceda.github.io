## Predicting Excitement for DonorsChoose.org

DonorsChoose.org is a charity organization where people from around the world can come together to help teachers and students in need. This project aims to identify projects that are "exciting" so DonorsChoose.org can effectively find and promote these projects to users and prioritize donations to where it is more urgently needed. Using machine learning and experimenting with various NLP techniques (bag-of-words, Word2Vec, and transfer learning), I try to create a model that can find these projects based solely on the teacher-submitted project essays.
