## Machine Learning with Apache Spark and Databricks

This capstone notebook goes into creating a basic logistic regression model and building out a model pipeline using PySpark. The data used is loan data from Lending Club. The final test confusion matrix is shown below. While it did not achieve the best performance, it was still good practice for getting familiar with ML modeling in Spark.
