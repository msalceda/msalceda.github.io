## Where's the Gorilla?

This notebook is from an experiment held by a professor where two groups of classmates were given the same data. The control group was told nothing about the data, but the test group was given some additional information. The experiment was to see whether having prior information influences what is seen in the data and any hypotheses drawn from the data. What this highlights is the important of exploring the data thoroughly; not only using statistics, but also visualizations.
