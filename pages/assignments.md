#### <a name="seas6401-final-project"></a>Final Project
##### Project Description
DonorsChoose.org is a charity organization where people from around the world can come together to help teachers and students in need. Teachers can use the DonorsChoose.org platform to put forward project ideas that they believe will help enhance their own students’ education and people can freely choose to donate money to one or several of these project ideas. Each project idea has a goal amount to be reached and if that goal amount is reached, DonorsChoose.org will take all the donations to that project and send the money/supplies in the project to the teacher. 

The mission of DonorsChoose.org is admirable, and the website itself is very nice and sleek, but there is one issue: with so many teacher projects on the site, how can people choose which ones to donate to without having to read through each and every project page? According to DonorsChoose.org FAQ page, “over 70% of projects reach their funding goal”, but of the 30% or less remaining projects, some of those could have been exceptionally important or unique. So how can DonorsChoose.org effectively find and promote these projects to users and prioritize donations to where it is more urgently needed? That is what my project aims to solve.

####  <a name="emse6574-assignment2"></a>Assignment 2
##### Assignment Description 
Create a graph class and use it to create a social network graph. Then, look at the FEC data, do some spelunking, and build a graph of connections you find in the FEC data.

[![nbviewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/msalceda/msalceda.github.io/blob/master/assets/emse6574_assignments/Week_2_Assignment_Michael_Salceda.ipynb)

####  <a name="emse6574-assignment3"></a>Assignment 3
##### Assignment Description 
Take a look at the FEC data and do the following:

1. Find three companies and look at if there are patterns in donations in two-week periods.
2. Determine who donates first in those companies.
3. See if you can find the political trends by zip code and compare how they match up to donations.
4. Apply a linear regression model to try to determine if a boss donating to a party causes employees more/less likely to donate to the same party.
5. See the party balance in Colorado.

####  <a name="emse6574-assignment4"></a>Assignment 4
##### Assignment Description 
Analyze `m_data` and `w_data`. What is it telling us? There were two groups: a contol group and a test group. The test group was told some additional information on the dataset. I was part of the control group - I did not receive any hints/information on the dataset.
